                        <p>
                            This project was an attempt to completely replace faces in video frames using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as classifiers on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We trained an SVM classifier to first identify a face in an image using HOG descriptors and then identify fiducial markers like eyes, nose and mouth in the identified face using Matlab’s Cascade Object Descriptor. Once a convex hull was identified in the target image face, Thin Plate Spline (TPS) morphing, alongwith Gradient Domain Blending, was used to warp features from source image face onto the target frame face.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We implemented an in-depth facial recognition algorithm, and also implemented substantial end-to-end face replacement.

                            Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression technique was used to create a uniformly distributed cornermap of the image. Once the cornermap was ready, Feature Descriptor for each point was defined by subsampling the image around that point by extracting axis-aligned 8x8 patches. To match the feature descriptors between two images, ratio of the 2 best matches was considered.
                            <br/>

                            RANSAC technique was then employed to remove incorrect matches. Finally, pairwise aligned images were overlayed with imwarp and bilinear interpolation to create the final mosaic image.
